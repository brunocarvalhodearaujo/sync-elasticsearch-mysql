## Introduction

This project is a working example demonstrating how to use Logstash to link Elasticsearch to a MySQL database in order to:
- Build an Elasticsearch index from scratch
- Continuously monitor changes on the database records and replicate any of those changes to Elasticsearch (`create`, `update`, `delete`)

It uses:
- MySQL as the main database of a given business architecture (version 8.0)
- Elasticsearch as a text search engine (version 7.9.3)
- Logstash as a connector or data pipe from MySQL to Elasticsearch (version 7.9.3)
- Kibana for monitoring, data visualization, and debuging tool (version 7.9.3)

![Architecture of this project](./docs/sync-elasticsearch-mysql.png)

This repo is a valid prototype and works as it is, however it is not suitable for a production environment. Please refer to the official documentation of each of the above technologies for instructions on how to go live in your production environment.

## Deployment
On your development/local environment, run the following commands on a terminal:

> Note: Make sure to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

```bash
# Clone this project and cd into it
git clone https://github.com/redouane-dev/sync-elasticsearch-mysql.git && cd sync-elasticsearch-mysql

# Start the whole architecture
docker-compose up # add -d for detached mode

# To keep an eye on the logs
docker-compose logs -f --tail 111 <service-name>
```

To start services separately or in a different order, you can run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d mysql
docker-compose up -d elasticsearch kibana
docker-compose up logstash
```

## Testing
Please refer to the above article for testing steps.
